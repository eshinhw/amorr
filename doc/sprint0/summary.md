## **Project Objective**
Design an online beauty catering service that allow users to book services they want, to be completed at their location of choice; and service providers to post the services they are willing to provide, at a cost of their choosing. Users and service providers will be able to create their own accounts to have access to book/post such services.

## **Key Personas**
1. Alice is a 65 year old woman that is retired and stays at home all day. She is relatively well off due to all her savings from the job she worked before. Her hobby is maintaining her home garden, where she was able to grow multiple plants in her backyard.
2. Ray is a man in his 30s and works in the field of civil engineering. He is a man of high stature, and therefore attends to multiple important meetings during his work.
3. Jack is a 29 year old man and works a 9-5 job 5 days a week. However, on many occasions he is required to work overtime till 8, and it is having an impact on his sleep schedule. He is currently very unhappy with his job and wants one that allows him more flexibility.

## **Key Scenarios**
1. Alice has hopes to maintain her home garden as she is really passionate about it. However, as she is growing old, she is unable to physically take care of the plants herself. She hopes to have a platform that will be able to connect her to people that are willing to take care of her garden for her.
2. Ray has a very important meeting coming up, and since the meeting is fully remote, he wishes to get his makeup done at home right before the meeting. He wishes to have a service where he is able to choose a suitable makeup artist online specifically for formal interviews, and have the makeup artist come to his home to do his makeup for him.
3. Jack has currently quit his job due to his friend's suggestion, and is now looking for a new job. Jack has a background in haircutting and hopes that there is a service which can match him up with people that need their hair cut, so that he is able to make a living off of his hair cutting skills.

## **Key Principles**
1. Intuitive and effective UI - The webpage should be simple enough such that it does not overload users with information, yet effective enough such that the users will be able to navigate through the website very easily to get to where they want.
2. The design of the website should also be very appealing so that even if it is services the users do not necessarily need, users browsing through the website could be lured in to hire such services.
