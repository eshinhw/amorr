# Release Goal
Our release goal is to have an app (at least a website) that is a platform serving customers to be able to order services and service providers can reach their homes to complete their tasks. 
Services are like: 
Hairdressers, Barbers, Cleaners, Landscapers, Masseurs, Makeup Artists, Eyebrow & Eyelash Techs, etc.

Also, for service providers, we wish them to have a place to earn their income with flexibility and easily.

# Project Scope
Users and service providers can see their profile page with customizable information about themselves and their service provider, additionally, they can set their working hours and the area they want to serve. 

Users can choose to have different services using by either searching or options provided on the homepage. 

After choosing what service users want and setting details like time and location, they will have access to pages containing the service providers' profiles including ratings from previous users and the money they would like to charge for the services. 

Users can then do a reservation with the service providers they preferred. 

After the service is completed, they can leave their reviews for this service. 

Users can reach out to customer service representatives for their concerns. 

Service providers can set up their account, working hours and area they preferred to work, their own PayPal account, upload their work as posts to attract more users, and see the data analytics to have an idea of their performance. Reach out to a representative for their concerns.
