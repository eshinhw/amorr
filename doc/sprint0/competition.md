TaskRabbit is the most competitive opponent, the main reason is it targets the market of North America. Care. com is targeting the same region but it segments more related to children's care and pet care. The target and segmentation make them less competitive. TaskRabbit has a similar solution to current services providing problems like scheduling, traffic, transportation, and quality issue. The solution is to provide a web application to gather customers and service providers, customers pay for task takers in-home services and transportation fees. In general, this is what aMORR going to do.   

However, the difference between aMORR and TaskRabbit will become the advantage. The segmentation of aMORR will focus on beauty services like hairdressing, haircutting, cleaning, massaging, manicure and nails, and makeup. This segmentation makes aMORR applicable to specific users. TaskRabbit has not expanded its market fully into Canada, and it bases in United State. It's time for aMORR to catch the opportunity and enter the market. 

Specific users should be customers who want to enjoy beauty services but face transportation problems or other issues that keep them at home, as well as service providers who want to make money on their own rather than opening a new store or trying to reduce their investment to earn money. Specific scenarios are customers ordering services on the website, and service providers going to the customer's place and providing service. TaskRabbit still does not focus on the Canadian market is due to the U.S. market is still not saturated. In addition, TaskRabbit provides general services like assembling, moving, cleaning, fixing, and delivering. It does not have a segmentation like Care.com. If aMORR is doing successfully in the future beauty market, it can expand the market to the general, and provide more services.

Eventually, eBeauty is trying to establish a profile system and membership system. The profile system is to help customers rate and inspect the service providers so they can choose who is going to serve them. Meanwhile, decent service providers can benefit from the profile system because can rate them a high score. A membership system is developed to prevent losing customers. Customer loyalty should be considered, membership can bind customers together and force them to use aMORR. These might be the core competence for aMORR vs TaskRabbit.
