# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants In Meeting

- Lin Lei
- Allen Lo
- Jason Chen
- Jin Ting Zhou
- Junxun Liu
- Hyun Woo(Eddie) Shin
- Yuehai Zhou

## Unfinished Tasks

Basically, all userstories in Sprint 1 were finished, and we just need to build database in the next step.

## Practices To Continue Using

- Do planing on discord planing chanel to set up the meeting time
- Do general discord meetings in small groups to fix any merge or rebase problem
- Do discord chat to fix or provide suggestions for codes
- Multiple people are working in one user story but seperate subtasks, small groups improve effectiveness
- Put Story ID/Task ID in the git commit messages

## New Practices To Use

- 5 stand up meetings instead of 3 due to more work load in this sprint
- Learn new stuff before every stand up meetings to ensure everybody catches up

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using

- Try not merge the feature branch too late or at the end of spring. It's bad for rebasing
- Working the documentation part as earlier as possible

## Best/Worst Experiences

- Best: After rebasing all the features together and making an unified style, the application UX (website UI) looked gorgeous
- Worst: When doing the System Design and CRC cards, it wasted too much time on the diagram tool, this time should do better.
