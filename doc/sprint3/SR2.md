## Unfinished Tasks

EB-6: As customer, I would like to change the address, so that the makeup artist can come to the address of my working place instead of my house. This user story is unfinished in sprint 2. It is because this task depends on that other user story have to create a user's database first, then he can start his work. There's also caused by encountering the challenge of fetching the address data from the database that we need more time to figure out.

## Practices To Continue Using

- Do planing on discord planing chanel to set up the meeting time
- Do general discord meetings in small groups to fix any merge or rebase problem
- Do discord chat to fix or provide suggestions for codes
- Multiple people are working in one user story but seperate subtasks, small groups improve effectiveness
- Put Story ID/Task ID in the git commit messages

## New Practices To Use

- Start the sprint 3 earlyer than sprint 2, sprint 3 contains more workload than sprint 2 which is 6 user stories.
- Do documentation earlyer, don't waste time on the documentation part during the wrap up meeting.

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using

- Try not merge the feature branch too late or at the end of spring. It's bad for rebasing
- Use other source of css files are not recommended, because it will cause the style conflict with the other source of css files.

## Best/Worst Experiences

- Best: After rebasing all the features together and making an unified style, the application UX (website UI) looked gorgeous
- Worst: Too many conflicts in dependency between the css files, it's hard to figure out the style conflict.
