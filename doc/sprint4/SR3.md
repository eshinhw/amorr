# Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants In Meeting

- Lin Lei
- Allen Lo
- Jason Chen
- Jin Ting Zhou
- Junxun Liu
- Hyun Woo(Eddie) Shin
- Yuehai Zhou

## Unfinished Tasks

EB-4: As customer, I would like to be able to schedule a time when the service provider can come so that I can make sure I'm home. Allen's note: This user story is not completed in sprint 3, this is due to various reasons, one could be rogers that caused difficulty to access to network, and spending more time on doing the optimization of user stories before (you can see the commit I did in both EB-16 and EB-4 after sp2). (and in my subjective opinion we spend more time on preparing midterm and some other courses' work)

## Practices To Continue Using

- Do planing on discord planing chanel to set up the meeting time
- Do general discord meetings in small groups to fix any merge or rebase problem
- Do discord chat to fix or provide suggestions for codes
- Multiple people are working in one user story but seperate subtasks, small groups improve effectiveness
- Put Story ID/Task ID in the git commit messages

## New Practices To Use

- Sprint 4 contains more workload than sprint 2 which is 6 user stories or even more, and exam and assignments are also included in this sprint. So try to leave less workload before releasing.

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using

- Try not merge the feature branch too late or at the end of spring. It's bad for rebasing
- Use other source of css files are not recommended, because it will cause the style conflict with the other source of css files.

## Best/Worst Experiences

- Best: After implementing the backend of the application, the application becomes dynamic and responsive.
- Worst: Some features are not fully implemented, and the application is not fully functional.
